# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 March 2022 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**

Got started on a Momentum clone using a tutorial. I would like to customise it by having a "Verse of the Day" also displayed.

**Thoughts**

I learnt that the app actually involves a lot more JavaScript than I originally thought - especially if I want to use an API to fetch bible verses.

**Learning points**

- `contenteditable` is an attribute that defined if an element can be editable by the user. It takes the values of `true` or `false`. I used this in the greeting textbox to alow the user to enter in their name and daily focus tasks.

**Today's Progress**

- [Publically committed](https://twitter.com/codewithsandra/status/1498411258038697992?s=20&t=YlzHiWTQ_50xu6izXA5_kw) to this challenge - so excited to be part of this journey.
- Updated my Github profile overview README.

**Thoughts**

- I will need to create a plan to effectively document my daily progress.
- Thinking of some fun projects I can build, I will update when I have something solid to work on.
