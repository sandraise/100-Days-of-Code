### [Day 3-6] Thursday, 3 March 2022 - Sunday, 6 March 2022

**Overall Progress**

- Created and updated some freelancing profiles

- Read a few JS articles covering OOP

### [Day 2] Wednesday, 2 March 2022

**Today's Progress**

Updated

**Thoughts**

I learnt that the app actually involves a lot more JavaScript than I originally thought - especially if I want to use an API to fetch bible verses.
Installed the Run-JS plugin that allows one to see JS code in the browser.

**Learning points**

- `contenteditable` is an attribute that defined if an element can be editable by the user. It takes the values of `true` or `false`. I used this in the greeting textbox to alow the user to enter in their name and daily focus tasks.

**Today's Progress**

Got started on a Momentum clone using a tutorial. I would like to customise it by having a "Verse of the Day" also displayed.
